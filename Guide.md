## FAQ / Tips:
---

### Use with Any App:
You're not limited to Discord!  
You can route your Vision Pro mic audio into any app that accepts audio input.  
Just set **VB-Audio Virtual Cable** as the **Input Device** in that app‚Äôs audio settings.

---

### Mini Mode - Floating Mute Button:
- Want to move the app out of the way but keep mic control handy?
- Tap **"Launch Floating Mute Button"** inside the app.
- This spawns a small, draggable mute/unmute button you can place anywhere in your space for quick access during gameplay or calls.
- A single tap Mutes the Mic audio (red). Tap it again to unmute. 
- A long press (hold) turns the icon (gray) and activates audio dimming based off the setting chosen in the Vision Pro MicStreamer app. This is designed to allow users to hold a conversation in the room without removing the headset while gaming. Release to return audio back to the previous state. 

---

### Wi-Fi Reminder:
- Your Vision Pro and PC must be on the **same Wi-Fi network** for low-latency streaming.

---

### No Audio? ‚òπÔ∏è
- Ensure:
  - The **Mic Streamer Windows** app is running and **Start Listening** has been clicked.
  - Untoggle/Retoggle Microphone Streaming in app.
  - If you switch focus away from Moonlight to another app (or the Vision Pro home screen) and then return, the Mic Streamer may stop sending audio until you toggle the mic stream off and back on again. This is due to how the Vision Pro handles audio session interruptions and app focus changes. Retoggling the Mic Stream will fix it. 
  - **VB-Audio Virtual Cable** is the **Default Playback Device**.
  - Discord‚Äôs **Input Device** is set to **VB-Audio Virtual Cable**.
  - Make sure you don't have the Draggable Mute Button muted. 

---

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD):
- You can enable **VAD** in the Vision Pro app for auto-mute when silent.

---

### Gain Adjustment:
- Adjust the **Gain** in the Vision Pro app if your audio is too soft or too loud.

---

### Antivirus Warning?
- Some antivirus software may flag the Mic Streamer Windows Receiver App on first launch.
- This is a **false positive** due to the app‚Äôs custom, unsigned code.
- You can safely **allow** or **whitelist** the app in your antivirus settings.
- IF the app becomes popular, I will certainly get the code signed.
