### Mini Mode - Floating Mute Button:
Want to move the app out of the way but keep mic control handy?
Tap "Launch Floating Mute Button" inside the app.
This spawns a small, draggable mute/unmute button you can place closeby for quick access during gameplay or calls. No need to pinch to click. 
A single quick tap with your finger Mutes the Mic audio (red). Tap it again to unmute.
A long press (hold) turns the icon (gray) and activates audio dimming based off the setting chosen in the Vision Pro MicStreamer app. This is designed to allow users to hold a conversation in the room without removing the headset while gaming. Release to return audio back to the previous state.



### ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads-Up: Unsigned App Notice

The MicStreamer Windows Receiver is currently **not digitally signed**, so you may see a Windows SmartScreen warning the first time you run it.  Click More Info -> Run Anyway to launch. This is normal for unsigned apps from independent developers. The EXE is 100% safe and open-source ‚Äî feel free to inspect the code or build it yourself.

## üìñ Full Setup Guide & Tips

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
  - Ensure the **Mic Streamer Windows** app is running and **Start Listening** has been clicked.
  - Untoggle/Retoggle Microphone Streaming in app.
  - If you switch focus away from Moonlight to another app (or the Vision Pro home screen) and then return, the Mic Streamer may stop sending audio until you toggle the mic stream off and back on again. This is due to how the Vision Pro handles audio session interruptions and app focus changes. Retoggling the Mic Stream will fix it. 
  - **VB-Audio Virtual Cable** is the **Default Playback Device**.
  - Discord‚Äôs **Input Device** is set to **VB-Audio Virtual Cable**.
  - Ensure the Mute Button isn't enabled.
  - The VAD (Voice Activity Detection) setting cuts off the voice stream to reduce latency even further. Disable to keep a constant voice stream.
